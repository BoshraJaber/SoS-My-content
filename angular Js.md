# Angular
- Angular is an open-source client-side JavaScript framework maintained by Google. Originally released in 2010 as AngularJS, it underwent a complete rewrite and emerged as Angular 2+ in 2016. Angular is built using TypeScript,

used for building dynamic and robust single-page applications (SPAs)

- Angular uses HTML templates enhanced with special elements and attributes that bind to data and display dynamic content. These templates serve as the building blocks for user interfaces.

-  Components are the core building blocks in Angular applications. Each component encapsulates its own logic, data, and presentation, making it easier to reuse and test.

- Directives are custom HTML elements or attributes that extend the functionality of standard HTML elements. Angular provides several built-in directives, such as ngFor, ngIf, and ngStyle, that enable developers to manipulate the DOM and apply dynamic behavior.

-  Services are singletons that provide functionality that can be shared across components. They handle data retrieval, authentication, and other business logic, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase.
- Dependency Injection: Angular uses a hierarchical dependency injection system to provide components with the services they need. This ensures loose coupling and facilitates unit testing.

- Two-Way Data Binding: One of Angular's standout features is its powerful two-way data binding. Changes in the model automatically reflect in the view, and vice versa, streamlining the development process and reducing boilerplate code. (It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which promotes a clear separation of concerns

Title: Unraveling the Power of Angular: Building Dynamic and Robust SPAs

Introduction

Angular, an open-source client-side JavaScript framework maintained by Google, has revolutionized web development since its inception. Initially known as AngularJS, it underwent a significant transformation and emerged as Angular 2+ in 2016, leveraging TypeScript for enhanced development capabilities. Angular has become a top choice for building dynamic and robust Single-Page Applications (SPAs), offering powerful features and a well-structured architecture. In this article, we will explore the key components and standout features of Angular that make it a force to be reckoned with in the world of modern web development.

The Building Blocks of Angular:

HTML Templates with Enhanced Elements and Attributes
Angular uses HTML templates enhanced with special elements and attributes that bind to data and display dynamic content. These templates serve as the building blocks for user interfaces.

Components: The Core Building Blocks
 Components are the core building blocks in Angular applications. Each component encapsulates its own logic, data, and presentation, making it easier to reuse and test.

Directives: Extending HTML Functionality
Directives are custom HTML elements or attributes that extend the functionality of standard HTML elements. Angular comes with a rich set of built-in directives, including ngFor, ngIf, and ngStyle, enabling developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and apply dynamic behavior to elements. Directives play a crucial role in creating interactive and responsive interfaces.

Services: Promoting Modularity and Maintainability
-  Services are singletons that provide functionality that can be shared across components. They handle data retrieval, authentication, and other business logic, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase.

- Dependency Injection: Angular uses a hierarchical dependency injection system , a design pattern that allows components to request dependencies (services) from a higher level, without having to know how those dependencies are implemented. This promotes loose coupling and simplifies unit testing, as components can be tested in isolation by providing mock services.


- Two-Way Data Binding: Seamless Communication between Model and View
One of Angular's most prominent features is two-way data binding, which automatically synchronizes changes in the model (data) with the view (UI) and vice versa. This means that when data changes, the view is updated instantly, streamlining the development process and reducing boilerplate code. Two-way data binding is facilitated by the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which ensures a clear separation of concerns within the application.
